          In Database Modeling and Implementation, I worked with a lab partner to design, document, and populate a relational database with the purpose of accurately representing the financial influence of Californian lobbyists and organizations on elections and legislation.
          Upon scraping countless tax documents off the government website <a href="https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/" className="underline text-blue-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">calAccess</a>, we matched each entity with its respective filer ID, which became a primary key for our entire dataset.
          Please review our Logical and ER models here to get a sense of our Database. With our design, we are able to answer questions like <span className="italic">"How much money did it take to get Keith Olberg elected?"</span>

          Our professor enjoyed our project so much he offered me a job â€“ and I ended up working for Digital Democracy (a branch of CalMatters) for the following year.
